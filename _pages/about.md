Hi! My name is Te√≥filo Dutra. I am a programmer with +7 years of experience in R&D. I have been passionate about video games and graphics since I was a kid playing River Raid on Atari. I ended up becoming a researcher on a related field (crowd simulation) and also became passionate about game development in general. Later I joined the industry to work with game development.

I am an inquisitive person, always eager to learn new things. In the same way, I enjoy sharing those findings, experiences and knowledge with the community.

In the recent years, I have been working mostly with VR, C#, Unity and shader languages. I try to keep up with C++ and other subjects by working on personal projects. Although my family is my priority in my spare time <i class="ti-heart"></i>.
