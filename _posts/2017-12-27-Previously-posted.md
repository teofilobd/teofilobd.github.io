A few months ago I posted two articles on gamasutra about some techniques and tricks used in [Angest](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/gear-vr/1199148026798440/) for GearVR. Using those helped us to achieve the good graphics and performance seen in the final release of the game. You can check them here:

In this first article, I talk about occlusion culling and tricks used to reduce draw calls.

In the second article, I talk about overdraw, texture compression, fake dynamic lighting, color grading and some tricks with cubemaps.

I might revisit some of these topics with more details in the future.
